# Obsidian Slugify Heading as Filename

This is an Obsidian plugin to keep the filename of a note synchronised with the slugified version of the first h1.

**Note:** This is a one way sync. It renames the file but *does not* change the h1. If you manually rename the file it *will not* change the h1.

## Features

- When updating the h1 of a file it will rename the file
- Opt in only: Only affects the files that you specify by regex

## Use Case

- A subset of your vault will be published, and you want web-safe and SEO friendly slugs based on filename
